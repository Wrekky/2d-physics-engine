//TODO: Make scene class, should inherit from application class but only override game object setup & player input. Current application.cpp will be a scene. Render should be universal.
//Will have multiple scene files defined like Scene1, Scene2, or just describing what they are.
//Will be similar to the shape class but split into multiple files due to expected size of each scene being pretty large. 
//Will have a method of switching scenes while playing, don't know the method yet.
